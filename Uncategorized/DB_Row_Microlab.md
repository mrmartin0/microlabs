# Database Row Microlab

Create a class to represent a row in a database. This lab will help with instantiation, variable declaration, and access control.

### Part 1:

Create a class called `Row`. Each instance of `Row` should have a unique id number, starting at 1, which can be read with a getter called `getId` but cannot be changed after the instance is created.

### Part 2:

A row that stores no data is not very useful in a database. Add `getAttribute` and `setAttribute` methods that allow the user to view and modify the attributes in the row (by providing the name of the attribute they wish to view or modify). You may have to change other parts of your class in order to achieve this.
